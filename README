THREE POYLMER
===============================
~THREE.js Components powered by Polymer~

So, I got inspired by https://github.com/kaosat-dev/polymer-threejs after a weekend game jam of creating https://github.com/SuicidalRobot/SuicidalRobot and getting fed up with debug tools. Thus THREE POLYMER was born.

Features

* Define your scene in HTML
